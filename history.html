    <h2>History of Floriography </h2>
    <div> <strong>Floriography</strong> :(language of flowers) is a means of cryptological communication through the use or arrangement of flowers. Meaning has been attributed to flowers for thousands of years, and some form of floriography has been practiced in traditional cultures throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa.

<b>Ancient and Early Uses </b> 
    
<b> Egypt, Greece, and Rome </b>
    Flowers played important roles in mythology, religion, and daily life.
    The Greeks and Romans associated flowers with gods and goddesses (e.g., roses with Aphrodite, lilies with Hera).
    Romans used flowers in festivals and ceremonies.
    
<b> China and Japan </b>
    The practice of assigning meanings to flowers dates back to ancient times.
    In Japan, Hanakotoba is the art of assigning symbolic meanings to flowers.
    
<b> Middle East (Ottoman Empire, 17th Century) </b>
    The tradition of sending coded messages through flowers was refined.
    The Ottoman court used a system of floral symbols called Selam to communicate emotions.

<b> Victorian Era (19th Century) – The Golden Age of Floriography </b>
    Queen Victoria’s reign (1837–1901) saw the peak of flower symbolism in England and the U.S.
    Strict social etiquette made direct expression of emotions difficult, so lovers and friends exchanged flowers with hidden meanings.

    Floriography books were published, detailing the meanings of different flowers.
    During the Victorian age, the use of flowers as a means of covert communication coincided with a growing interest in botany.
    Gifts of blooms, plants, and specific floral arrangements were used to send a coded message to the recipient, allowing the sender to express feelings of romance and courtship which could not be spoken aloud in Victorian society.
    Armed with floral dictionaries, Victorians often exchanged small "talking bouquets" or "word poesy,” called nosegays or tussie-mussies, which could be worn or carried as a fashion accessory.
    The word "nosegay" was used because the flowers would smell nice and the word "gay" meant ornament. These accessories were originally worn to mask the scent of the streets and body odor, and were often composed of fragrant herbs and flowers such as lavender, lemon balm, and roses
    During the 16th century, the purpose of the tussie-mussies changed. They were commonly gifted to a love interest. The meaning of flowers was determined by their cultural meanings along with legends and myths. In England and America, courses such as botany, painting flowers, and floral arranging became popular in education, especially for young women.[8] Tussie-mussies are still used in modern-day as corsages and boutonnieres</p>
